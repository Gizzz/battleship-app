This app uses create-react-app as foundation.  

Live version could be found here:

To start the app locally, install all dependencies (`npm i`) and start the app (`npm start`).  
The app is now available at localhost:3000.  

**!BONUS:** Additional content available in `dev` branch. It shouldn't be taken into account while evaluating the original task, but maybe helps to follow the code logic. In `dev` branch the code is refactored bit: 
- reshape state of Board component for clarity
- extract logic of Board to container component
